# Platypodes

`npm install --save-dev platypodes`

A build tool, very early in development.

Platypodes transforms directories. You have to give it 3 things:
 - A source directory: the subtree where all your source code lives
 - One or more entry files (relative to src dir)
 - A loader/transformation function - to compile/transpile your code and resolve
   inter-file dependencies

Platypodes outputs a Vinyl stream, so you can feed the output to any gulp
plugin, or you can let your loader function to all the hard work and just
pipe the output to a destination directory.

## Example

```javascript
const path = require('path')
const Platypodes = require('platypodes');

const builder = new Platypodes(
  // Add a source directory
  path.join(__dirname, 'src'),

  // A loader, or file transformation function
  function (file /* vinyl file */) {

    // Filter by file extension
    if (file.path.match(/\.html$/)) {
      const contents = String(file.contents)

      // Look for linked dependencies (this is na√Øve for demo purposes)
      const img = contents.match(/<img href="(.+)">/)[1]

      // Add the file to the output stream
      return this.entry(img).then(
        newImg => {
          // The file contents or filename may have been transformed by
          // another part of the loader function - so get the new name and
          // replace old references.
          file.contents = new Buffer(contents.replace(img, newImg.path))
          return file;
        }
      )
    }

    // Return the file unprocessed if no loaders match
    return file;
  }
)

// Add a couple of entries - linked images will be automatically included
// by the loader.
builder.entry('index.html')
builder.entry('page1.html')

// Pipe all built files to the dist directory
builder.pipe(
  // The dest function is the same one gulp uses
  Platypodes.dest(
    path.join(__dirname, 'dist')
  )
)
```

## Loader function

The loader function is pretty dumb by default because I want people to be able
to write their own abstractions for it. You may like to use a webpack-style
config object, gulp-style stream, or something completely different.

I hope to come up with my own system with plugins for common things like
js and css transpilation, but I'm not exactly sure yet what form this system
will take - it will likely be trial and error.
